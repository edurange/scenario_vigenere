To My Beloved Family:

As some of you have already heard, I've decided to join the monastery.
Any further attempts to convince we otherwise will be futile; by the
time you are reading this, I will already be gone. As my first step into
this new life, I am relinquishing all of my material belongings.
The house is going to my beloved sister and Johnny gets the Harley.

For the rest of you, I leave the first bread crumb to a trail that leads
to an extraordinary treasure. It's location and contents will be
revealed along the way. The figurine in my entryway holds the first
of several encrypted messages. Solve it and you'll have the location
of the next. Flowers are the key. Good luck!

Love you all,
Marcia
