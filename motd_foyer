As you arrive at your Aunt's house, your see your cousin
Johnny in the driveway mounting the Harley. "Hey!" he shouts
to you, "the message is inside. It's just a bunch of
gibberish anyways." He roars off before you get a chance to
respond, obviously satisfied with his new motorcycle.

You try the front door, only to find it locked. A quick glance
shows the deadbolt locked; your credit card alone won't get
you through this door. Taking a step back to glance if any of
the windows are open, you notice the pot of geraniums to the
right of the door. Hidden underneath you find her house keys.
Not exactly what you expected from "flowers are the key," but
easy enough.

Sitting right inside is a small figurine of Julius Caesar,
a replica of Coustou's famous statue at the Louvre. Lying at
its feet you find the your first encrypted message.
